# Continuous Organisation DAO
The contracts here describe a continuous organisation (based on two bonding curves) whose investment capital goes to voting contract. The voting contract is meant to govern the software and business development of an application - SQDGLS.

The voting contract has many specifics. Some of theme are outlined in the list below:
- The disbursing of funds is based on categories. Categories like any other thing in here are proposed and voted upon.
- The categories have two types - competing and non-competing
- The competing categories define rounds, in which different entities can submit proposals and a winner amongst them is chosen. (for now the proposal is governed by "governer". Not ideal and should be changed, but helps fight spam.)
- The non-competing categories operate in principle the same way MolochDAO works - people submit proposals (they deposit CO tokens in order to do so) and the comunity votes for or against it.
